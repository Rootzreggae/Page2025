  ## The challenge
Engineers struggle with tracking, managing, and rotating API keys across platforms, leading to security risks and wasted time. Existing solutions are expensive "Swiss army knives" with unnecessary complexity.
  ## The approach
  I set out to create Keystrok - a focused, open-source tool that does one thing exceptionally well: manage API keys across platforms while providing:
  - Visual dashboard with expiration date monitoring
  - Automated key rotation with notifications
  - Simplified interface accessible to technical and non-technical team members
  - Cross-platform compatibility in one centralized system

**Process & Development**

## Initial Research & Ideation

I wanted to learn what strategies other devs were using to accomplish this task of managing . Then one of the participants mentioned using different tools to solve the problem, noting it wasn't ideal but was good enough to get by.

I found that intriguing. I did some research on tools that manage APIs and most of them feel like a Swiss army knife. They allow API key management but also do a lot of other API-related tasks.

I noticed that these tools had a steep price because of the extra functionalities. But what if there was a tool solely for managing API keys, that catered to a broad audience, and was open source?

After my research, I set a plan to create a v0 concept of such a solution. Granted, I don't know much about API keys, secure databases, or even core functionalities that are standard in similar tools, but I still wanted to work on this project. Why?

I recalled what my ex-boss at Grafana Labs, Tom, said to me once when I mentioned that I was worried about the market share of the tool I was building, that maybe it wouldn't be interesting enough for customers.

His words to me were: "It's a big world, there are many people that might want to migrate to a different tool, cheaper, with different offering - don't worry about that."

That made sense at the time and it does now. It kind of re-arranged the way I think about product feasibility and market fit.

I wrote down what I think are valuable features for a v0 proof of concept and created a plan around them. There's the design part and the technical part.

## Design & Development

I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, so I figured with some AI help I can build something that works well for a v0.

  ## Design Process

  I started sketching out user flows and wireframes to envision how developers would interact with the tool. My primary focus was on creating an intuitive interface that would:

  - Provide immediate visibility into key expiration status
  - Simplify the rotation process with clear action buttons
  - Organize keys by platform for easy filtering
  - Include notification settings that wouldn't overwhelm users

  After several iterations based on feedback from developer friends, I refined the UI to emphasize the most critical information and actions.

What about aspects like security and databases? I have close to no knowledge on the subject, but I am determined to learn as I go, making mistakes but ultimately bringing this idea to life.

I made a survey targeting developers on Lemmy, Reddit and developer friends about their experience managing API keys, and sure enough there's frustration around keeping track of and managing keys. One friend, who leads engineering at a mid-sized SaaS company, told me they once had a security incident because an expired API key wasn't properly documented and someone reused it in production. Another mentioned spending nearly two hours trying to track down which developer had created a particular key that was hitting rate limits.

I decided to name the tool 'Keystrok', as it helps you manage, monitor, and automatically rotate API keys across all your platforms, reducing security risks and saving you valuable time.

The core feature I'm most excited about is the visual dashboard that gives a bird's-eye view of all active keys across platforms, with color-coding for expiration dates and usage patterns. This provides immediate visibility that most existing tools lack. I've also designed an automated rotation scheduler that sends notifications well before expiration, something my developer friends specifically mentioned would save them headaches.

Looking at the benefits of Keystrok, I can see several advantages:
- It focuses on doing one thing really well instead of being a complex multi-tool
- The open-source nature means transparency and community contributions
- It's more affordable than the expensive Swiss army knife solutions
- Automatic key rotation improves security without manual intervention
- A simplified interface makes it accessible to non-technical team members
- Cross-platform compatibility means no more juggling between different systems

But I'm also realistic about the challenges and drawbacks:
- My limited knowledge of security best practices means I'll need to learn as I build
- As a newcomer in this space, building trust will take time
- The tool might lack some advanced features that enterprise clients expect
- Without proper documentation, adoption could be slow
- Being open-source means figuring out a sustainable business model

Despite these challenges, I believe Keystrok addresses a real pain point. The frustration I've heard from my developer friends confirms there's room for improvement in how we manage API keys. Starting small and focused feels like the right approach - build something that solves one problem exceptionally well, then grow from there.

Looking ahead, I envision Keystrok evolving to include team collaboration features and integration with popular DevOps tools. I'd love to see it become a standard part of security workflows, especially for smaller teams that can't afford enterprise solutions.

Working on this project has already taught me so much about security concepts and user experience considerations in technical tools. I've learned that simplifying complex security tasks doesn't mean dumbing them downâ€”it means making them more accessible without sacrificing functionality. I will continue evolving this project and eventually release as open source.

I have a working demo v0 available here <a href='https://kzmlp8p7l52gway5174b.lite.vusercontent.net/login'>here</a>. For now, I'll keep the repository for this tool private, until I get more knowledgeable about security and get more feedback from testing sessions. I will continue to work and grow this tool and see where it leads.
