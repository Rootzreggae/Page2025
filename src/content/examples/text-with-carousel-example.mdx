# Text with Carousel Component Example

<TextWithCarousel 
  images={[
    { src: "/sample-image-1.jpg", alt: "Sample landscape image" },
    { src: "/sample-image-2.jpg", alt: "Sample portrait image" },
    { src: "/sample-image-3.jpg", alt: "Another sample image" }
  ]}
>
  ## Left Column Text
  
  This is the text content that appears in the left column. You can include any MDX content here, such as:
  
  - Lists
  - **Bold text**
  - *Italic text*
  - [Links](https://example.com)
  
  The carousel on the right automatically adapts to both landscape and portrait images, ensuring they display properly regardless of orientation.
</TextWithCarousel>

## Reversed Columns Example

<TextWithCarousel 
  reversed={true}
  images={[
    { src: "/sample-image-4.jpg", alt: "Another landscape image" },
    { src: "/sample-image-5.jpg", alt: "Another portrait image" },
    { src: "/sample-image-6.jpg", alt: "Final sample image" }
  ]}

  ## Right Column Text
  
  In this example, we've reversed the column order so the text appears on the right and the carousel on the left.
  
  This component is designed to be highly flexible and reusable throughout your MDX content. You can:
  
  1. Use it with any number of images
  2. Place it anywhere in your MDX files
  3. Customize the column order
  4. Add any MDX content in the text column
