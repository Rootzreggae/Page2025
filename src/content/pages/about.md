 I've always been fascinated by technology and how things work. As a kid, I was notorious for disassembling electronic toys to figure out their inner mechanics - much to the dismay of my mother, who would often scold me for opening presents before I even got to play with them. But despite the occasional frustration of taking things apart only to realize I had no idea how to put them back together again, my curiosity drove me to keep learning.

 That's when Photoshop caught my eye on a demo CD that came with a magazine. I was hooked from the very start - the endless possibilities of layering, blending, and manipulating images was like nothing I had ever seen before. It was during this time that I also discovered Adobe Illustrator, and it was love at first sight. There's something about creating vector art that just clicked with me.

 As my passion for design grew, so did my online community. I co-founded an art forum with some friends, where we would share our work and ideas. It was an incredible experience - not only did I learn from others, but I also got to showcase my own talents and receive feedback from like-minded individuals. This is when I first started learning HTML and CSS, as I realized that design wasn't just about creating pretty visuals, but also about bringing it to life with code.

 My curiosity soon took me down a different path - I became obsessed with video games! Who wouldn't want to create their own characters, worlds, and adventures? So, I dived headfirst into game development using the Mugen engine. It was an incredible learning experience that taught me about design principles, problem-solving, and collaboration.

 After completing my studies in Communication Design at the Lusophone University of Humanities and Technologies in Lisbon, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in digital product design. My goal has always been to blend creative minds with technology to create solutions that enhance user experiences.

 As a designer, my motivation is simple: I want to add value to businesses by providing teams with a deeper understanding of their customers and the ability to make informed decisions. I achieve this by extracting meaningful conclusions from customer feedback and stakeholder research, and then using those insights to design best-in-class solutions that tackle complex problems.

 My approach is centered around creating scalable interfaces and interactions that are not only visually stunning but also user-friendly. I contribute to our design system, ensuring consistency and quality across all products, and work closely with cross-functional teams to lead the design process for core product experiences.

 One of my favorite things about being a designer is identifying areas of improvement and prioritizing them through a design lens. I love working hand-in-hand with designers to refine our approach, ensure coherence, and drive innovation.

 Collaboration is key in my role - I work closely with engineers, conduct research, and develop design strategies to achieve product goals. My ultimate goal is to create high-quality designs that maintain the design system, provide a seamless user experience, and make a real impact on people's lives.

 I'm always excited to share my knowledge and enthusiasm with others. When I'm not working, you can find me enjoying calisthenics, indulging in video games, or picking up my pencils to illustrate - the creative spark never truly goes out for me. Above all, I cherish the time spent with my loving family and friends here in Lisbon's South Bay, Portugal - this is where my heart feels most at home.
