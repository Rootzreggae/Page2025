I'm a product designer specializing in developer tools and observability platforms. My broad design background helps me create technical products that feel surprisingly human.

**Why I Design for Technical Products**

Complex problems energize me. Transforming observability data into actionable insights at Grafana taught me that the harder the technical challenge, the more impactful good design becomes. There's nothing quite like making a developer say "finally, this makes sense!"

**Real-time impact at scale**

When I improved time-to-insight by 20% on Grafana's APM tools, it meant thousands of engineers could identify and fix issues faster. Technical products aren't just interfaces - they're tools that keep the internet running.

**Collaboration with brilliant minds**

Working closely with engineers has sharpened my thinking. I've learned to ask "what's technically possible?" before "what's ideal?" - and finding elegant solutions within those constraints is where the magic happens.

**The perfect blend of art and science**
Designing dashboards that visualize millions of data points requires both aesthetic sensibility and deep understanding of how developers think. It's this intersection of creativity and logic that keeps me in technical products.
